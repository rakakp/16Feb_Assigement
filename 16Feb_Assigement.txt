''' Q2. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases. '''
''' A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. '''

''' Q2.
 Data Definition Language(DDL) is a subset of SQL and a part of DBMS(Database Management System). DDL consist of Commands to commands like CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE and DROP. These commands are used to create or modify the tables in SQL.

CREATE : This command is used to create a new table in SQL. The user has to give information like table name, column names, and their datatypes.
CREATE TABLE Student_info
(
College_Id number(2),
College_name varchar(30),
Branch varchar(10)
);

ALTER: This command is used to add, delete or change columns in the existing table.
ALTER TABLE Student_info
ADD CGPA number;

TRUNCATE : command used to remove all rows from the table, but the structure of the table still exists.
TRUNCATE TABLE Student_info;
	
DROP: This command is used to remove an existing table along with its structure from the Database.
DROP TABLE Student_info;	
'''

''' Q3 

Data modification language statements (DML) INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Use the INSERT command to enter data into a table. You may insert one row at a time, or select several rows from an existing table and insert them all at once. VALUES ("5555555", "Jones", "Jane");


    The INSERT statement is used to insert a new row in the database that is adding data to a table.
	INSERT INTO Students(StudentId, StudentName, DepartmentId, DateOfBirth)
              VALUES(11, 'rakesh', 4, '1997-10-12');
			  
    The UPDATE statement is used to update the data or row in the table.
	UPDATE Students
		SET DepartmentId = 3 
		WHERE StudentId = 6;

    The DELETE statement is used to delete a row from the table in the database.
	DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentId = 11 OR StudentId = 12;
	
'''

''' Q4 

Select * from Students;
It displays all the records from the student table as shown above.
SELECT * FROM student where age>15 and age<20;
(OR)
SELECT * FROM student where age between 15 and 20;
'''

''' Q5 
Primary Key: A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence

A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. 
'''

''' Q6 
A cursor is an object which helps to execute the query and fetch the records from the database

#python cursor_object.py

#import the library
import mysql.connector

# creating connection
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="abc",
  password="password"
)
#print the connection
print(conn)
mycursor = conn.cursor()
#print the mycursor
print(mycursor)

The execute () method helps us to execute the query and return records according to the query.

#python simple_execute_function.py

#import the library
import mysql.connector

# creating connection
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="abc",
  password="password",
  database ="dbTest"
)

# import the cursor from the connection (conn)
mycursor = conn.cursor()

mycursor.execute("SELECT * FROM MOVIE")

# iterate over the result
for row in mycursor:
    print(row)

# we close the cursor and conn both
mycursor.close()
conn.close()

''' Q7 
Query Process Steps

1. Getting Data (From, Join)
2. Row Filter (Where)
3. Grouping (Group by)
4. Group Filter (Having)
5. Return Expressions (Select)
6. Order & Paging (Order by & Limit / Offset)
